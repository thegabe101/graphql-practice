GraphQL Notes

- GraphQL is a layer between the front and the backend. 
- GraphQL is not a database. It functions as an API, or a query API tool. 
- There are two types of requests: a query and a mutation. 
- A query is of course a GET; mutations include PUT, DELETE, POST, possibly more.
- This is a basic way of thinking of it.
